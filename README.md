# portfolio-website
My personal portfolio website.

For my personal project I decided to create a personal portfolio to display some of the work I have done so far on my journey learning coding.
I hope to use this website as a basis for my personal portfolio one day when I feel I am ready to start looking for work. I includes examples of websites and webapps I have build.

It is fully responsive and using CSS and SASS and to fulfull the requirements to use both a flexbox and grid, I decided to use flexbox to style the biography section on the front page, and a grid to style my projects on the folio page.
